# Tech Blog

## Description
This project uses a full stack to create a tech blog forum. Current functionality is limited, but when it is complete users will be able to log in, read and write blog entries, and add comments. It has been a challenge to get the authentication process up and running, but I have enjoyed getting a feel for how the files connect to each other across the project.

## Installation
When it is running, users will be able to acces the webpage without installing any software. The page can be accessed here: 

## Usage
On the home page, users can click on a blog entry to read more for each entry. Users who are logged in can also access a dashboard to create and add their own blog entry. Logged in users also have the option to add comments to other blog entries.

## Credits
This project closely follows the examples found in the Module 14 activities to structure the files and achieve functionality.
